# Searching Algorithms

## 1) **Binary Search** :
- ### An algorithm that searches for a value by **starting at the center of the input array** (cuts the array in half), then determines if the target value is greater than, lesser than or equal to the middle value
- ### It *returns* either the **index of the target value OR -1 (if not found)**
- ### If the value is not the center value, the algorithm then detects if the target value is greater than or less than the current (center) value
- ### The left (if the value is greater) or right (if the value is smaller) portions of the array are then removed (cutting the array) in half again
- ### Therefore, instead of needing to iterate over every value (Linear Search), it continously cuts the array in half until it pinpoints on the target or the target is not found
- ## **Think Searching a Dictionary**
  - ### If you want to find a word starting with the letter "M", you don't check every word from A --> M. You skip to the middle to find what you need.
- ### Only works if the values are **sorted in numerical or alphabetical order**
